                The Coin Flip Experiment is a web-based interactive simulation that visually demonstrates the principles of probability and randomness using a simple coin flip scenario. This experiment involves 1,000 participants, each flipping a coin, with the outcomes (Heads or Tails) displayed in real-time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project was designed to provide an engaging way to explore the concept of randomness. Whether you're a student, educator, or just someone interested in probability, this simulation offers a hands-on approach to understanding how randomness works and how it can be observed in real-world scenarios.

                Some of the key features of this project include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coin Flip Simulation:</strong> Simulates the coin flips of 1,000 participants with results displayed dynamically.</li>
                <li><strong>Filtering Options:</strong> Allows users to filter the results to see only the participants who flipped Heads or Tails.</li>
                <li><strong>Reset Functionality:</strong> Resets the experiment, allowing users to start over with a fresh set of participants.</li>
                <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> A clean and intuitive interface that makes the experiment easy to use and understand.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This project is an excellent example of how simple concepts can be brought to life through interactive web development. It was created to serve as both a learning tool and an entertaining demonstration of probability in action.

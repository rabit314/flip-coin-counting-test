# Coin Flip Experiment

This project is a web-based simulation of a coin flip experiment involving 1,000 people. Each person flips a coin, and the results (Heads or Tails) are displayed. The project includes several features such as filtering by Heads or Tails and resetting the experiment.

### Features

- **Coin Flip Simulation:**
  - Each person flips a coin with results shown as "H" (Heads) or "T" (Tails).
  - The simulation includes 1,000 people represented by emojis.

- **Buttons:**
  - **Flip Coins:** Flips the coins for all remaining people without resetting the total count.
  - **Filter by Heads:** Removes all people who got Tails, leaving only those who got Heads.
  - **Filter by Tails:** Removes all people who got Heads, leaving only those who got Tails.
  - **Reset:** Resets the experiment back to 1,000 people with their coins unflipped.

- **Counters:**
  - Displays the number of times each button (Flip, Head, Tail) has been pressed.

- **Version Information:**
  - The current version of the site is displayed at the top right corner of the screen.

### Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file that structures the webpage.
- **style.css:** The CSS file that styles the webpage, making it visually appealing and responsive.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the coin flip experiment, including flipping coins, filtering results, and resetting the experiment.

### How to Use

### Developer Notes

This project was developed to demonstrate a basic yet interactive web-based simulation. The focus was on creating a simple user interface with clear and responsive interactions. Future updates may include additional filtering options, statistical analysis of results, and enhancements to the user interface.
